# Bagging-based Group Detection Algorithm

* To detect group user based on community detection algorithm - louvain. 
* Support Spark 2.0.

## Louvain Algorithm
The Louvain Method for community detection is a method to extract communities from large networks created by Vincent Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte and Etienne Lefebvre. The method is a greedy optimization method that appears to run in time O(n log n). More comprehensive information please refer to [wiki - Louvain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_Modularity).
## Usage
